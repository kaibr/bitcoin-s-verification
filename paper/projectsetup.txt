\paragraph{Using the Stainless-sbt-plugin vs Using the Stainless-JAR}

We can either use the sbt plugin or a JAR file to check code with Stainless.

More about sbt on https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/index.html (features are also listed there)
Installation see Stainless Doc 'Installing Stainless' section


Invoking the JAR on our source code Stainless will verify it.  If we
have a bigger project, this becomes really tricky, because we must
pass all files needed including the dependencies.  This is in contrast
to the sbt plugin, where we can integrate Stainless in our compilation
process.  When we call compile, Stainless verifies the code and stops
the compilation if the verification fails.

Having a static version configured in the sbt build file, every
developer has the same Stainless features available.  This should
prevent incompatibility with new or deprecated features when we use
different plugins.

So the sbt plugin has clear advantages over the JAR file since its
integrated directly.  We do not have to download it manually and find
the right version and if we bump the version we can just edit it in
the build file and every developer is on the same version again.

However, currently there are some drawbacks.  For example the sbt
plugin does not always report errors.
use sbt-plugin because of library management and replicability (everyone uses the same Stainless version configured in sbt)


We use the jar for everything. 


Use JAR:
Download all library dependencies including dependencies of dependencies, pass libraries + source to JAR
  
Use sbt-plugin: integrate in sbt build tool with addSbtPlugin() method

Why JAR:


no sbt because

-- version conflicts, stainless 0.1 uses older sbt version than bitcoin-s (v0.2 not)
-- no output maybe \href{https://github.com/epfl-lara/stainless/issues/484}{issue 484 on
  GitHub}


\paragraph{Reproducing our Results.}

Prerequisites:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Java 8 in /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk (Stainless requires and Scala recommends Java SE Development Kit 8. Newer Java versions won't work.)
\end{enumerate}


\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
 clone repo
 run ./code/bin/stainless.sh <path to code>
   eg. ./code/bin/stainless.sh code/addition/src/main/scala/addition/reduced/
\end{lstlisting}
