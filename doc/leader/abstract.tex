\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{chap:abstract}

In this thesis we try to verify some properties of Bitcoin-S.

First, we look at some theory about formal verification, Stainless -- a verification tool and Bitcoin-S -- an open source implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.

Then, we try to verify that a non-coinbase transaction should not generate new coins.
We create a transaction and check it in Bitcoin-S.
After some time we realize that it is not possible with the current tools and the given time.
But because we familiarized us with the Bitcoin-S code we find a bug and send a bug fix to the Bitcoin-S project.

So we verify a less interesting property of Bitcoin-S.
There is a datatype Satoshis that represents bitcoins. We verify that the addition of Satoshis with zero results in the same amount of Satoshis.
Even this needs many changes in the code that we go through step-by-step.

Finally, we see that software should be written with verification tools in mind, because otherwise the code possibly must be rewritten when it comes to verification.
